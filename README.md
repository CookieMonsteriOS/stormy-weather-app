# Stormy

Stormy is a weather app built with Swift that retrieves and parses weather data from a weather API. It utilizes UIKit for the user interface and CoreLocation for location-based weather information.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Display the current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- **Forecast**: View the weather forecast for the upcoming days.
- **Location-based Weather**: Get weather information based on the user's current location using CoreLocation.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Primary programming language used for development.
- **UIKit**: Framework for building the app's user interface.
- **CoreLocation**: Framework for determining the device's geographic location and obtaining weather data accordingly.
- **Weather API**: Integration with a weather API to fetch weather data.

## Installation

To run Stormy locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project file in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.

## API Keys

Stormy relies on a weather API to fetch weather data. You'll need to obtain an API key from a weather service provider and replace it in the appropriate place in the code. Make sure to keep your API key secure and do not expose it publicly.
